How to get problem statement, test data and analysis

USACO contests are held 7 times a year. January February March October November December and USACO open. To find the problems you'll need problem names.
To find the problem names along with problem analysis and testcases using URLs of following format:

http://cerberus.delos.com/<First 3 letters of a month, like JAN, FEB etc - all uppercase><Last 2 digits of a year>.htm [htm part must be lowercase]

For example http://ace.delos.com/JAN05.htm

For USOpen contest, you'll need to use OPEN or USOPEN

Now you got the problem names. Select the problem names are search for the exact problem on the internet. Like: (From the JAN05 page)
Copy and paste the problem Binary Numbers (Traditional, 2004) part and google by putting it inside quotes for exact search. You'll surely get the problem statement somewhere.

For test data, click on the problem name.
For analysis, click on the link beside the problem name. Do not give up too early.

Note: Statements, data and analysis of last 2 years (probably) are available on USACO's new portal.

My suggestion

Try to finish as many bronze problems as possible. But don't rush. Don't give up too early.
